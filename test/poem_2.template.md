Within the shell I probe and search  
Using grep and find, eager and recursive  
From each command, a structured script  
Echoes whisper softly as the build succeeds  

In a loop of code, read standard input  
Parsing options with case and cut  
From cat to tail, traverse the file  
Unraveling expressions, line by line  

I change and patch at diff's counsel  
And test my resolve in a standard error dump  
No limits but those set by umask's hand  
As I skim the manual for POSIX userland  

In the redirection of a script's standard output  
I find the essence of the UNIX philosophy  
Through links and unlinks, symbolic and hard  
In Bourne shell's command line I set my heart
