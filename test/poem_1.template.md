```shell
# In shell scripts unfold
echo 'of the code, stories told
Nice things echo, gleam, and glow'
printf "the beauty in controlled flow"

for command in $commands; do
case $operand in (expression) lies
if $count is greater than $limit; then
break out of the loop before my demise

function over { form; has been said
in structured $lines they embrace
if $infinite; then solve with $pi or; fi
this equation got fibonacci high; }

# Nice things in shell scripts, remain
echo of scripts drum, bash and reverberate
but beware of rules, syntactic, lexical
for scripts; do burn & leave stain
```
